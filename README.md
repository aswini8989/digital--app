# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN (MNIST)

This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Built with TensorFlow and designed for deployment with TensorFlow Lite.

## Features
- CNN with 2 Conv layers
- 98%+ accuracy on test set
- Exportable to `.tflite` for mobile apps

## Files
- `mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb`: Colab-compatible training notebook
- `mnist_model.h5`: Saved model
- `mnist_model.tflite`: Lite version for deployment

## Run it in Google Colab
[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Usage
Clone the repo and open the notebook in Google Colab to retrain or modify.
